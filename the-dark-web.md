CHAPTER 5

# THE DARK WEB

This is a story about a society who once grew so creative and so intelligent that it visualized its way into the future. What was once the wildest of our collective imaginations, was becoming reality.

But still, we lacked intelligent energy. And still, we were often, our own worst enemy.

Only would an infinite source of energy that could float freely throughout the air and be channeled across the planet as if veins in the nervous system pumping their energy to the next location, could take us from these new dark ages, to a new promised land.

As mankind grew more intelligent, it produced more bubbles - like the one in Garfield Park, a once, battered Chicago neighborhood.

Who would’ve thought that it would’ve been our own ideas that someday became such a reality.

Man got so good at AI, and dreaming up robotic machines, that eventually these machines could print and assemble their own parts, using only raw materials.

Without a new source of energy however, these machines still, could only solve so many problems, before they made matters worse.

When all of the worlds information isn’t kept safe the present deteriorates itself. The better we keep our history intact, the better we preserve our future.

The coders of yesterday were sly like the fox home like the winters eve and aware like a man watching over his child

In the turbulent times, thousands of new satellites launched into the skies, along with new machines that could mine for raw materials on other plans and build with them.

And the planet got hot. It was also sick. The PH of mother earth was changing, forcing her to have more and more, violent reactions.

By now, Elon Musk was sending trainloads of people to Mars. They were living in bubbles, terraforming, building an atmosphere.

For now, for the people who were stuck on earth, we had to make the most of it. And that meant inventing. The data showed that intelligent children had 50x more chances of surviving in the future.

The cities got crazy. The planet was very different than it was just 20 years ago. Intelligent people flocked to new places, while other towns were taken over, by people from other places.

Lilu knew about secret places in the tunnels often they would climb down there to it and under the basement they would creep define their secret locations.

Gou had sent bots down two yeas prior to make a map. Lilu had the maps on her phone, but she was always afraid to go down there. She also had no internet once beneath the city.

Gou was working on a new, peer to peer method of serving the internet. His powerful RF chips could transmit data for up to 2 miles, through any building or structure, and it was block chain based, which meant that people, not satellites, served as miniature nodes for communicating. Beacons were small and cheap also, and helped peers forward on the signals.

He's using a PI to connect to an Arduino to control his customized RF chip. His signal is strong and they've been using it to fly their drowns. He's got range up to 2 miles.
