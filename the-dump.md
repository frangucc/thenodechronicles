**Prologue**



And so here begins The Node Chronicles, where sometime in the not too distant future, “Gou Sokyeo” will become, no doubt, a unicorn beast.

Unfortunately, the World as we knew it had become a very difficult place to live. The Great Loss of Direction gave rise to dishonest governments and filthy rich mega corporations, ruled by the wealthiest of wealthy and their clans; humanity had reached a tipping point. 

As the turbulent technology era struck, a certain schitzophrenia took over the people, and ultimately, humans grew less sufficient and mentally weak. It was still unclear if society would come together and prevail, or if the civilization as we know it, would fall. 

In a time when the next generation most needed an answer, Gou Sokyeo would soon bring the world together with an open source solution that could forever unlock each of owns destinies. 

Unfortunately, becoming a unicorn of his had also become very dangerous. Gou Sokyeo, his brother Nōn and sister Lilu now faced many new challenges.  

For the people, Gou encoded each aspect of the teaching as a symbol and created a new periodic table of electrical computing elements. So that we would never forget, he laser enscribed them into a crystal quartz stone. For each collection of symbols unlocked together, an opportunity would prevail, and a new device could be created to help contribute towards the future. 

"I’ve created a collection of symbols that represent everything you need to know about electro mechanical machines of all sizes, even biological."

The open-source pioneering work you'll complete with Gou will lead you into the world of coding, hardware hacking, peer-to-peer networking, circuitry, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Eventually, Gou and his teachings will help instill a profound cultural foundation of knowledge that you can use to pioneer in every field. 

A civilzation free from subscriptions, surveillance, money and consumerism, is on the verge and for the next generation, it's back to the drawing board. 

So tonight, as dawn approaches, stay awake with Gou from his old Garfield Park Manor HQ, together with Node and The Sokyeo Clan and hack your way into your own personal future:

Aware, like a fox crossing the water. 
Alert, like a general on the battlefield.
Kind, like a hostess greeting her guests.
Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood.
Opaque, like black pools in darkened caves.

Introduce the Human Taxonomy Project

The world became obsessed with marketing as people became more and more predictable. "People are walking libraries of traits that marketers could manipulate to empty your wallets." 

The human taxonomy project gave AI an API to help figure people out better, so they could act more natural and appealing to different types of people.

You feel me G?

Revisit the Turing machine, and remove some of the big words kids trip on. 

Deciphering, Algorithm, Exploit, Encrypt, AI

**Instead use: **Crack, Code Theory, Take Advantage of, Artificial Intelligence

Watch the words you use.

Make new artists stay focused on their unique sections. Every artist starts off with a 1 page splash sketch, then inks and colors it. If they're is good and on time, they can follow-up and ink 3 related pictures that explain the splash. If they inks are good they can color and they can complete the full scene: 8-12 pages. That artist will own that section until flawless.

Would be cool to explore your interpretation of a 2-3 page scene using a desired technique - possibly something partially monotone where the main character is moving through out a troubled near future interpretation of Chicago after the rise of inflation, the deviation and unicorn boom.
