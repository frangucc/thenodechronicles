# GEEKING OUT

![](https://cl.ly/0s42011Q0G0G/TNC_Banzi.jpg)

Millenials are wicked fast on technology. They use shortcuts, find information out quickly and are incredibly omnivorous in how they learn, but they also fall into different types of traps than older generations expect them to, and they often take a lot of blame for that. They value learning deeply over money more so than any prior generation, yet they deal with life differently than we do, and other generations have a hard time understanding that. They don't get it.

As an example, they are texted to, not called. Facetimed, not visited. They are pushed but would rather be pulled. They get their news differently, make their decisions their own way, and so on. They value friend time like any other generation, and doing stuff, but in terms of education and careers, they compete in their own ways.

What typically drives anyone, millenial or not, is: wants, needs and desires. It's also often observed that **discipline** is driven by pressure, **success** by gratification, **careers** by challenge and **passion** by love and appreciation.

Take for example, the 15 year old boy Malawian, William Kamkwamba, who after reading a book called Using Energy, decided to create a makeshift wind turbine at his family's house in East Africa using blue gum trees, bicycle parts, and materials collected in a local scrapyard.

Since then, he has built a solar-powered water pump that supplies the first drinking water in his village and two other wind turbines \(the tallest standing at 12 meters \(39 ft\)\) and is planning two more, including one in Lilongwe, the political capital of Malawi.

Learning Computer and Electric Science is no different. I suspect the next generation will want to know all of it, deeply, but that their impetus for doing such will be something beyond other generations comprehension. Ultimately, their decisions will be fueld by their concerns for the future, while their actions will be dictated by the things they know, the words in their vocabulary and state of their environment.

And we must accept that it could take years for a bright mind to discover their calling, and that right after high school or college, millenials might not be that concerned with settling down in the way previous generations had been. Eventually, those who are led to this will make their way.

So rather than aimlessly stack scientific concepts and experiments one after another, directly on top of each other, this book elaborates on the universal language and emotion around the science, and on how those same feelings are ultimately responsible for what we might choose to do in this industry.

Need you be reminded of the crazy stuff going on right now with VR/AR, Hololens, BioHacks, Data Science, AI, Bayesian Systems & Neural Networks and Higgs Boson? It's as if a new periodic table was formed right under our noses in the past 20 years and we're just learning how to use it.

I want to create a piece of scientific equipment, in the shape of a wizards wand, that can log movement from tiny IMU's within the stick and use real-time Kalman filtering to ultimately generate AR visualizations.
