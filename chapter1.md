What's all this mean tho Gou, not everyones a genius like you. And what's a Rosetta stone dammit?

**Bruh. You're not listening.** What I'm telling you is like, giving you a **Rosetta Stone,** for figuring out high tech hacking.

![](http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/19400/19491/rosetta_ston_19491_lg.gif)

Yeah, but I'm not a math genius. I can't just learn this stuff like you, I'm not as smart as you.

But I really want to know this stuff like you!

**How you going to** learn **applied mathematics or coding** if you can't COMPREHEND what I'm telling you? And I'm not that booksmart either, I'm just a _hustler._ Ummm.. my **my teacher say's I'm really great at "comprehension! Does that help?"**

![](http://acmac.uoc.gr/ICAM2013/img/ICAM2013_Banner.jpg)

**Yes,** that's good, because I can lead you to water but **I can't make you drink**.

\[Never depict anything corny like a horse drinking water, but let's find a metaphor.. Hmm... got one, the sip from the CAP bottle being played with in the game of cap.\]

_Random Cast Dude or NodeBot Says:_ "Mark Zuck teaches the entire Facebook team the hacker way, which is all about having a true comprehesion of electrical engineering and computer science"

![](http://cdn.torontolife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KaylaRocca-TorontoLife-FacebookCanada-9001-2000x1333.jpg)

\[Scene of Mark standing up on a big stage for a keynote speach, talking about his billion dollar investment into ending cancer.\]

![](https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/mark-zuckerberg.jpg)

\[Gou ironically hands a bottle of water while is **playing "cap" **with the bottle - they're in the basement headquarters....\]

![](http://originsin.adaderana.lk/webgossip/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/cvr-35.jpg)

Don't facebook employees make a ton of money?

![](http://img.timeinc.net/time/photoessays/2006/inside_google/google/01.jpg)

Bruh. They have the life.

I'm in dude. I'm going to commit to this and see if I can hack it.

Bruh, you don't want to just hack it, you need to own it. :p

\[first emoji pack\]

Tell me more about this stone.

The stone was a hack written on a stone. It was **writen in Egyptian, Greek and Hyroglphs** at once so that anyone in the future could read what the **pharoah** had to say, but it also helped archeologists understand those ancient languages. The stone acts as a legend of sorts.

![](http://www.freemaninstitute.com/RosettaStone-FenwickLOC%20074-750pix.jpg)

**So how's that relate? **

There's a **very specific set** of things **you need to know about EECS**, there's **even symbols** that represent the important **fundamentals you need to know**.

![](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/00/6a/c1/006ac13bed80faac37ace6630c6d311a.jpg)

In addition to these **key schematic symbols**, I'm giving you all the rest of the must know things. Here, I put them on some cards for you called **Axiom Cards**.

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1475871937/electro_magnetism_axiom_card_pyjnr5.png)

Owning these cards is the key to becoming a hacker. Once you collect them all and understand them you can make some serious money.

Yeah, I even made an app so you can keep tabs on this stuff. It keeps track of what you know and gives you props and stuff when you POWN shit.

Money????

Yeah dude, Citrus Byte pays me $75 an hour to hack on iOS and Android apps.

Is that where you get all that money?

Yeah, from that and, my EGHHHEM, COUGH, bitminers.

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ihMqEDs4B8/maxresdefault.jpg)

\[suble clue on bitfarm - but easter eggish\]

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1475878026/symbols_hlwrtf.jpg)

**I'm gonna give you a similar stone right now, that will act as a legend for deciphering this stuff, it even has some "glyphs" of it's own.** It will help you always follow and **understand this stuff**, or **guide you**. If you follow the stone, you will **become an EECS major. **

curl -v [https://cdn.contentful.com/spaces/vmrfpc9i6eu8/entries?access\_token=fba05696091f9eeec52131c7dbaa07801aa215f0bd30606debe5fcecf8a0d5de](https://cdn.contentful.com/spaces/vmrfpc9i6eu8/entries?access_token=fba05696091f9eeec52131c7dbaa07801aa215f0bd30606debe5fcecf8a0d5de)

It's the hackers guide to EECS man.

EECS?

**Archimedes** would **be turning in his grave right now...**

Electrical Engineering and Computer Science

**Whaaa?**

**Yeah, it's the dopest industry to be in. **

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1475878072/everywhere_nxytrz.jpg)

Yeah, but you've been doing this stuff for a hot minute Gou. And isn't hacking bad? \[redundant\]

Bro, **Tesla was a hacker**. Like, the maker of the cars? **Bruh,** will you shut up** for a second** and **listen**.

**Nikola Tesla was hacking electricity** and Thomas Edisons **Direct Current** empire when he discovered one of the most important aspects of modern electricity. **Alternating Current. **

Hackers are just people that don't want to accept bullshart as the norm, so they mess around and try to beat tech. They **are always trying to figure out the next move by learning from what's out there**. As a result, they help figure out what to **build next**. Or how to fix things so they can better benefit the **overall industry. **

\[illustrate hackers at industry, awesome jobs, working on cool shit, hackathons, Illustrate the GAME! search these things, hackerspaces, hackathons, hacking, clean rooms, computer science labs, mit labs\]

**Hackers.** \(huh...\)

Yeah, dude, **Alan Turing,** the dude who invented the **modern concept of a computer,** was literally **CRACKING the German Enigma** when he came up with the** Turing Machine.** His hack saved millions of lives in WWII. The turing machine is the premis for how all modern processors and memory inside your computers work, and how computer think. It's how all that stuff you **play with on your phone get's processed by the chips and stuff!**

**Ok, so go on.** **Tell me more.** I want to be a hacker.

**Bruh,** first you need to understand that to **comprehend this stuff**, you need to **take notes** on what I'm telling you and you need to **fit the pieces together **yourself. I'm only going to **give you clues** on what must know things you need to study.** I'll point you in the rigt direction**, always, but if you have what it takes to a hacker, you'll **figure this crap out yourself**. There's no need to pay attention to other stuff. I've got your **Rosetta Stone **for learning this shit.

**Hahah. Gou's Stone. **

**Here's **how it all basically works.

\[We need a literally "text" vesion of Gou's stone we can give away\]

\[And we need a dope glowing stone that can represent the legend for all 5 volumes and mastery of EECS. It should look like a combiation of the rosetta stone and some cool glowing stone.\]

\[DIAGRAM/IMAGE/ART - intro to MAP, finger points on a page to map or whiteboard. Map or Stone Map, or the stone is a place on this map... So far on the map we have - {Gous stone, the basement hq, the EE pyramids in an area, the OS land, the Coding building and Network - it's a very high level diagram for now, but you can tell it will be zoomed into later for deeper subjects. sneak in some other mystery - Dads dirty closet, Lilu's tree-house, the rabbi's temple, dr. winslows lab, ladybugs hideout, teslas corporation, zuck...}

**If you understand electrcity,** **fields, forces and flows**, it becomes easier to **visualize** how the lowest level of the **science and tech works** - when it's **beyond the naked eye** and you're dealing with **binary and math.**

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1475878073/molecule_csquem.jpg)

**So** I need to be a math geek?

**No, **but you **\*\*need to respect it and **make room for it.** A lot of math is done for you and not everyone has to understand **machine code** and **nyquist rates\*\* to build stuff.

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1475878071/boom_rye5oi.jpg)

**But** if you wanna get into MIT, and you don't understand the basics of **Electromagnetism**, **current**, **frequency**, **key algorithms, etc.** you're not gonna get very far.

**Like** the Big-O notation?

**Will you stop!** That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. But, well, yes, like the Big-O, but not in that example. Ughh,,.. Nevermind.

Non: So all these **chips and machines** that make up our **hardware, these microprocessors, memory, motors, etc.** all basically take **voltage from power** sources and **translate them into information **or **motors** somehow?

**Yeah, sorta. **

**Check it.** Basically, you need to know about** electricity and chips,** how they work, and then you need to know how to** put an OS on them **so you can **control them or write pograms to control them**. When you **write the programs**, that's when you'll study **object oriented or functional software. **

**That's when **you write the codes...

**Yup.**

**And** once you know about that stuff, you can learn to **put all your stuff online **and **control stuff** from anywhere you are.

**Like the matrix?**

**Bruh. **Will you stop with the analogies, let me make the analogies.

Ok.

**So let me recap.**

**Electricity & Chips =&gt; Operating Systems like Linux =&gt; Coding and Scripts =&gt; Networking and the Internet?**

**Yes. **Study the stuff in **that order**. And **don't go off the path** - learn what I give you and nothing else right now. There's no time for wastin - it's getting late, you're **already in high school and you're still a newb**. If you don't **grasp** this stuff now, you'll have a** 2% chance** of winning at all in this field.

**Bruh, **please. I'm non-che-b, Gou-nin-yho.

Please don't call me that.

Gou: **Do** you even know what software **engineers** make? Or hardware **hackers**?

Non: **No, **but I know I'd rather be a **Zuck or an Elon Musk** any day of the week before a **Kanye or Kardash.**

Gou: **Kan-yeezy** bruh. Don't dis Kankye. He's so **baller**.

**Dab. **

Ok, let's start from the beginning. What did Tesla do and what do I need to know about him?

I like where your heads at.

So check it out....

\[**More Story:** the Tesla back-story\]

\[**Labs:** the 3 EMF projects - inject axioms here\]

\[**Quiz:** fields, forces, flows, binary, electromagnetism, frequency.\]

\[**Story:** a trip back to the origin of the bagdad battery\]

\[**Labs:** some power and voltage tests, metering, frequency, etc - inject axioms here\]

\[**Story:** back to Tesla getting jack and some investor, patent, vc politic stuff\]

\[**Quiz:** on patents, venture capital, incubators, college labs, academic research, whisky\]

\[**Story:** to where Elon Musk takes over\]

\[**Lab: **put in a sonar sensor to show how automoous cars move around.\]

\[**Quiz: **what are sensors\]

\[**Story: **Wrap with Banzi and Adafruit democratizing the parts so we could test this stuff\]

\[**Labs: **give a couple final bonus projects you could do on these boards\]

\[**Conclusion & Badges: **End with a recap of the test projects and test users, ensure everyone collected their axiom cards and met their obligations. don't let anyone move forward who hasn't earned it by unlocking the "code snippets" on the internet in verios locations that when entered, will unlock their final test.\]

## End Intro Talk between Gou and Non. Begin seguay to Tesla, Baghdad battery and come back to present with Gou getting ready to do his first hack with EMF, Hall Sensors, Etc.

> **Chapter 1 \(Stealth Mode\) - **If we want to get into the lowest level of hacking and computing, we need to understand electricity, circuits, **fields, forces and flows.** Our main figure is Tesla here, as he was a huge thought leader in the area of energy, electricity, alternating current and more. We end this chapter with mention of John Bardeen and Jack Kilby of UoI **who created the transistor and integrated circuit,** which later would become the premise of **modern PCB boards and chips.** Our roots with Tesla however encourage EE's to think beyond such limitations, as **some day computing will go beyond phsyical boards** and move into nano and other forms. Tesla will help us understand the basics of **electricity**. Tesla's life was also interesting and had plenty of suspense, drama and turmoil. He is an excelent reminder of the historical role venture capital has played in innovation \(and lack there of\). We even make mention of Banzi and share a brief history of how **the Arduino open source microcontroller** has expanded our horizons even further.

Another description of chapter \(_please merge_\).

> **Chapter 1 \(Stealth Mode\) - **Tesla and the basics of electricity and circuitry with references to John Bardeen, Jack Kilby and Banzi. Experiments with the Arduino and **blinking lights, electricity, voltage, measuring voltage**, the very basics come together here while Gou fires up some basic breadboards and circuits. Energy! Theoretically, this chapter gives us a neat little intro to energy, voltage, electricity, basic circuits and some simple Arduino test projects that include **resistors, conversion, capacitors, voltage, flow, current - very basic and simple circuit patters, gates, logic, fields, electromagnatism.** We also disect an Arduino and get into the GPIO. You'll walk away with electrical engineering symbols, ability to read basic schematics and a really good understanding of fields, forces and flows. You'll finish with a higher level program, possibly in C or Python that ties together the stuff you learned into a program that can for loop across the electrical setup you've put together \(possibly blinking led patterns or a motor project\).

There is a great mix of the very basics of Electricity and Computing in this chapter.

**MAJOR TODOS**

* Must tie together Tesla portion with Gou's portion and introduce the expiraments.
* Add several illustrations for Tesla that can bring the story full circle into the scientific Axiom Cards \(place the cards\)!
* Rethink the illustrations for GOU and the scenario in which he's exploring the basisc of electricity and electronics. 
* Decide what Arduino board UNO vs. Nano we will be using and what intro tutorials will best demonstrate the key concepts \(elctromag, ac/dc, analog/digital,fields-forces-flows, voltage\) - what expiraments can we do here?

BEHIND THE POLICE OFFICERS STANDS A MAN IN THE SHADOWS WHO IS PRESUMED TO BE JP MORGAN JR, WHO IS CONTROLLING THE COPS. JP IS WEARING A LONG COAT, TOP HAT, CANE AND HAS A SHINY GOLD POCKET WATCH.

* **SOUND:** CRAAAK--THUMPPPP

* **7 JP MORGAN:** I got you're letter. Did you think you could undermine my family?

* **8 TESLA:** How could you, these are my ideas, electricity should be free, its not yours to control!

> **PANEL SIX** - TESLA IS LEFT CRUSHED, HIS IDEAS, STOLEN AND CRUSHED, HE HAS BEEN DEFEATED. SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR HIS TOWERS WERE DESTROYED BY THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE JP MORGANS INSTRUCTIONS. THE COPS AND JP MORGAN HAVE RAIDED THE APARTMENT, DESTROYED EVERYTHING AND LEFT TESLA GRIEVING FOR HE KNOWS HE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SUCCEED WITH FREE ENERGY.

* **9 TESLA, WHISPER:** The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine.

* **10 CAP:** The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.

Description of the non-technical content.

## Screenplay overview, _non-technical_

This brings us to modern day and introduces us to Gou Sokyeo. We learn about his normal state, mindset, love for tech, family structure, environment, home and about some of the gadgets he produces.

# MAIN SCRIPT B-SIDE

## _MAY NEED TO RETHINK THIS PART_ SO IT TIES INTO ARDUINO EXPIRAMENTS AND PICKS UP WHERE TESLA LEFT OFF....

## Screenplay overview, _technical portion_

The main goal of this chapter is to get the reader to understand the major boards he uses and how to boot them, get to terminals, install some packages, navigate linux a bit and get their basic tools in order.

Tutorials need to be dumbed down and extremely DSL/Object/Verb oriented - almost as if a new way of writing tutorials. This is my conceptual way of writing them.

Maps and visualizations of these steps are key. We must become the BEST in the world at tutorializing steps like this....

# MAIN SCRIPT C-SIDE \(kilby + bardeen? outro?\)

Gou needs to conduct his first electrical tests here. If we need to bust out an arduino at this point we can.

Basically, we can't start with that other scene - needs to tie together what tesla was doing with modern day go - stealth mode + electricity tests, basic pings, voltage, energy, capcitators, elctromagnatism.

Time-line A Highlights: [See Full UOI Timeline](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/about/history/#1800)

> 2014 - Associate Professor Gabriel Popescu uses [white-light diffraction tomography](http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v8/n3/images_article/nphoton.2013.350-f4.jpg) to capture 3-D images of cells with no dyes. This means the cells remain alive, allowing researchers to study them in three dimensions over time. As a result, researchers can observe how cells respond to specific drugs or treatments.
>
> 1972 - Electrical engineering and physics Professor [John Bardeen receives](http://www.famousinventors.org/images/john-bardeen.jpg) his second Nobel Prize in physics, this time for co-developing the theory of superconductivity with J. Robert Schrieffer and Leon Cooper. Bardeen had won his first Nobel in 1956 for co-inventing the transistor.
>
> 1958 - UOI ECE alumnus Jack Kilby \(BSEE '47\) invents the [integrated circuit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Kilby_solid_circuit.jpg) while working at Texas Instruments in Dallas.
>
> 1890's - Tesla invented electric oscillators, meters, improved lights and the high-voltage transformer known as the Tesla coil. He also experimented with X-rays, gave short-range demonstrations of radio communication two years before Guglielmo Marconi and piloted a radio-controlled boat around a pool in Madison Square Garden. Together, Tesla and Westinghouse lit the 1891 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and partnered with General Electric to install AC generators at Niagara Falls, creating the first modern power station.
>
> 1889 - General Electric organizes the first modern research-and-development laboratory. Edison begins work on a storage battery for use in electric cars.

**TODO**

* These should probably be 2 separate chapters!!!

Tesla part which leads to =&gt; AtoD, AC, Current, Electricity Basics  
Politics show =&gt; greed, patent, investments, venture capital, protecting ideas

**RANDOM NOTES**

* We've illustrated some of the political history and higher level concepts of Tesla and Turing... But we need to ensure a cohesive, historical story is told.
* We also need a clear breakout and transition into the technology they created with a clear technical description, references and QR codes out to each. 
  * Section QR Codes should be about: AC-DC Tutorial Example
* Axioms for Tesla section should include: Voltage, Electromagnetism, Vibration \(other?\)

1. Introduction: Coulomb's law, superposition, energy of a system of charges.
2. Electric field: Basic field concept, flux, Gauss's law.

3. More electrostatics: Energy in the field, potential. Some math: gradient and divergence; revisiting Gauss's law.

4. Divergence and curl: This lecture was described by at least one student as "all of 18.022 in a single lecture".

5. Conductors: Fields and potentials around conductors; the electrostatic uniqueness theorem.

6. Capacitance.

7. Current: Basic notions. Current density, current, continuity, Ohm's law.

8. Circuits: Basic notions. EMF and Kirchhoff's rules.

9. Variable currents: RC circuits, Thévenin equivalence.

10. Magnetic fields and forces: Basic properties of the magnetic field and the forces it exerts; special relativity not assumed. This deviates from Purcell's approach.

10a. Clarification to Lecture 10: One calculation in Lec 10 was rather confusing; these notes are my attempt to clear things up.

1. Special relativity 1: Time dilation, length contraction, Lorentz transformations, tranformation of velocity.

2. Special relativity 2: Forces and fields in special relativity. Equivalence of the electric and magnetic forces.

3. Return to magnetic fields.

4. Introduction to Induction: Faraday and Lenz.

5. Mutual and self inductance.

Notes on complex numbers. The only sane way to analyze AC circuits, in my not-so-humble opinion.

1. RL circuits, undriven RLC circuits: What we get when inductors and resistors are combined in circuits. Also introduces the use of complex numbers to analyze circuits.

2. AC circuits and impedance: Our first examination of alternating current circuits. Key things to learn here: life is a lot easier if we use complex numbers in our analysis; Ohm's law works perfectly for all circuit elements --- resistors, capacitors, inductors --- provided we use a quantity called "impedance" to relate voltage and current.

3. More on AC circuits: Power in AC circuits; resonance and filters.

4. Displacement current and Maxwell's equations: Here we finally put everything together and get the full set of "field equations" which describe electricity and magnetism.

5. Wave equation and radiation: Here we massage Maxwell's equations a bit and find a particularly interesting solution: Electromagnetic radiation.

6. Polarization and scattering: Some particularly interesting and important properties of radiation.

7. Energy and momentum in radiation: We examine how electromagnetic energy flows, deriving an extremely important quantity \(the Poynting vector\).

Note: The following two lectures were not part of the core 8.022 material when I lectured \(particularly lecture 24!\).

1. Magnetic fields and materials.

2. A \(very\) brief introduction to general relativity.

**Must Know EE to Prose concepts**

Well it depends upon your field of work. I will answer this question according to my field of work, i..e Analog/RF design.

1\) Things covered in your Electrical Science courses. Current, voltage laws, equivalent circuits. resonance circuits etc.  
2\) Transistor physics, its working, its limitations etc. Analog/RF Circuit Design concepts.  
3\) Digital Circuit Design concepts \(flip flops, gates etc.\), because you will be using them to control your analog/rf circuitry.   
4\) Control Systems. Your concepts of poles and zeroes and stability related concepts need to be clear for you to make stable circuits.  
5\) Electromagnetic Theory- The concepts of impedance matching, transmission lines, strip lines etc. come into play mainly in RF design.  
6\) Coding skills, at a minimum in MATLAB for you to effectively design circuits. Moreover, you might also need to have some advanced coding knowledge, if you plan to model your own devices and stuff. You might also want to know Verilog-A or Verilog-AMS.

To get to the heart of EE, you need to grasp fields, forces and flows.

Electromagnetism is one of the fundamental forces and is the glue that holds all matter together. Find out how photons, the charged particles that allow us to see the world around us, are at the heart of electromagnetism. When you study EE at MIT, it's one of the first things you need to comprehend.

This video explains it...

**QUICK HISTORY**

The field of electromagnetism was only six years old when Henry began teaching at the Albany Academy in New York. Danish scientist Hans Christian Oersted had discovered in 1820 that an electrical current in a wire from a battery caused a nearby compass needle to deflect.

GO BACK GO 3RD CENTRUY BC

3rd century BC: the Baghdad Battery is dated from this period. It resembles a galvanic cell and is believed by some to have been used for electroplating, although there is no common consensus on the purpose of these devices nor whether they were, indeed, even electrical in nature.\[1\]

The term Baghdad Battery AKA Parthian Battery is used to refer to three artifacts which were found together: a ceramic pot, a tube of one metal, and a rod of another. The current interpretation \[citation needed\] of their purpose is as a storage vessel for sacred scrolls such as those from nearby Seleucia on the Tigris.

> You don't need to know how to make a processor or too much about the inner workings of memory, but understanding what's generally going on is useful.

"If you want to find the secrets of the Universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration."

Yeah, but what's this got to do with microcontrollers and arduinos?

Shut up.

In 1887: Nikola Tesla develops an induction motor that uses alternating current, or AC, instead of direct current. Do you realize what this meant? This was when everything really got going...

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Rotterdam_Ahoy_Europort_2011_%2814%29.JPG/1920px-Rotterdam_Ahoy_Europort_2011_%2814%29.JPG)

An asynchronous motor type of an induction motor is an AC electric motor in which the electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is obtained by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding. An induction motor can therefore be made without electrical connections to the rotor as are found in universal, DC and synchronous motors. An asynchronous motor's rotor can be either wound type or squirrel-cage type.

Here are 10 other things Tesla created...

Today, the dude who's picked up where he left off seems to be Elon Musk.

Ok, so what's this got to do with computers man. I thought we we're gonna learn how hack or make robots?

Bruh, chill. First, the binary system, which is how all computers move information around, has everything to do with electricity and power. Second, shut your mouth.

> A microcontroller with a small computer on a single integrated circuit containing a processor core, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals.

Yeah, so a microcontroller isn't a computer?

> A computer generally made with a processor, memory and programmable input/output peripherals. With a hard disk, it can retrieve programs and run their instructions using it's operating sytem.

A microcontroller is a simple computer that can run one program at a time, over and over again. It is very easy to use. A Raspberry Pi is a general-purpose computer, usually with a Linux operating system, and the ability to run multiple programs. It is more complicated to use than an Arduino.

Linux!!! Don't get excited newb. Let's start by understanding how some of the basic parts of a computer all work. Ok.

The processor is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place. Calculations?

The processors arithmetic logic unit \(ALU\), which performs arithmetic and logical operations. \(011101010 + 001010100\) like that? Something like that... Bruh, this shit is hard.

Then give up, I got no time for negativitity. Ok, sorry, sorry, keep going, this stuff is interesting.

The control unit \(CU\), which extracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes them, calling on the ALU when necessary.

The whole things looks like this...

\[Depiction\]

Look inside this processor, it's magical. It's a highly complex, extensive set of electronic circuitry that executes stored program instructions. Only a real low level engineer interested in making chips need care about some of this stuff.

All you need to know is how fast and how much they can handle. Let's run a benchtest on this ARM 7 and see how fast we can get it to move.

Intel and AMD make the fastest processors in the world, but ARM makes chips for tiny computers like the PI. They're really only needed when making a really fast gaming, video editing machine or super computer for doing stuff like, DNA sequencing. DN whaaa?

A microcontroller \(or MCU, short for microcontroller unit\) is a small computer \(SoC\) on a single integrated circuit containing a processor core, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals.

You need to know about these, and the Arduino and PI will help you understand the lowest levels of how computers work. You need to understand the basic structure of a computer bruh. Check it out. Let me break it down for you.

**The Processor needs memory. ** So it can store what it processes, binary. For now, just think of the processor as your heart, and the memory as your brain. The CPU keeps pumping through the data but the memory stores it, so it can be remembered. Inside every computer, there's a little interconnected factory of data being pushed around in circuits being warehoused in places.

Computers don't remember or forget things the way that human brains do. Computers work in binary.

Memory is a simple electronic system, consisting of millions of individual cells. These cells all have unique addresses. They store 1 bit of data – either a ‘1’ or a ‘0’ – that either a high or a low voltage. We call this binary.

Now just like humans have a long and short term memory – a computer also has 2 types of memory. A permanent \(or longish\) memory \(ROM – Read Only Memory and maybe a hard-disk\) and a short term ‘scratch pad’ like memory called the RAM \(Random Access Memory\).

The ROM usually contains information that seldom changes and needs to be preserved. For e.g. it may contain a set of instructions that the computer is required to perform when woken up \(called powering up\).

The RAM on the other hand contains data that is generated while performing various tasks \(called instructions\). The scratch pad needs to be large enough and ‘well-managed’ enough to be able to store most of the intermediate data generated without having to erase some and copying it back.

_\*Condenese thes 2 descriptions_ and put back up-top\*

Computers don't remember or forget things the way that human brains do. Computers work in binary \(explained more fully in the box below\): they either know something or they don't—and once they've learned, barring some sort of catastrophic failure, they generally don't forget. Humans are different. We can recognize things \("I've seen that face before somewhere"\) or feel certain that we know something \("I remember learning the German word for cherry when I was at school"\) without necessarily being able to recollect them. Unlike computers, humans can forget... remember... forget... remember... making memory seem more like art or magic than science or technology. When clever people master tricks that allow them to memorize thousands of pieces of information, they're celebrated like great magicians—even though what they've achieved is far less impressive than anything a five-dollar, USB flash memory stick could do!

A newcomer was shown around;

There's Archimedes with his lever  
Still busy on problems as ever.  
Says: matter and force are transmutable  
And wrong the laws you thought immutable.

Too bad, Sir Isaac, they dimmed your renown  
And turned your great science upside down.  
Now a long haired crank, Einstein by name,  
Puts on your high teaching all the blame.

"I am much too ignorant, my son,  
For grasping schemes so finely spun.  
My followers are of stronger mind  
And I am content to stay behind,  
Perhaps I failed, but I did my best,

What in these symbols has power?  
None of my letters could build you a tower,  
But something within the screen of my phone  
Has mass, has inertia, has song, has tone.

Where are the electric lines?  
Neither hither nor thither, whichever one signs  
But for some reason, I can't help but feel  
That my electric lines are something more real.

What are the squiggles that wave from afar?  
A symbolic cookie from an imagined jar?  
Or are they a prize for forming a speak  
That, through my squiggles, may squeak?

This current resistance  
in our duel circuit is  
measured in ohmmms  
of my meditated solace,  
Mediated by the breaker  
of a once-broken man  
wary of a blown fuse  
too burnt to salvage, a  
lost cause to discard,  
Replace & repeat with  
each carless disregard of   
the whattage we're wired  
to handle, may a switch  
on to off when overblown  
prevent the spark that  
burns down a home.

While listening on my cosmic phone  
I caught words from the Olympus blown.  
A newcomer was shown around;  
That much I could guess, aided by sound.  
"There's Archimedes with his lever  
Still busy on problems as ever.  
Says: matter and force are transmutable  
And wrong the laws you thought immutable."  
"Below, on Earth, they work at full blast  
And news are coming in thick and fast.  
The latest tells of a cosmic gun.  
To be pelted is very poor fun.  
We are wary with so much at stake,  
Those beggars are a pest—no mistake."

Come, Kelvin, I have finished my cup.  
When is your friend Tesla coming up."  
"Oh, quoth Kelvin, he is always late,  
It would be useless to remonstrate."  
Then silence—shuffle of soft slippered feet—  
I knock and—the bedlam of the street.

An ARM processor is one of a family of CPUs based on the RISC \(reduced instruction set computer\) architecture developed by Advanced RISC Machines \(ARM\). ARM makes 32-bit and 64-bit RISC multi-core processors.

**Warehouse Diagram Aanalogy **

As the name suggests the memory is accessed randomly by different applications.

Imagine you are the owner of a large ware house consisting of different goods. You have to ship them around to different destinations. As you cannot move the warehouse to each and every location, you buy a Goods Carriage \(lorry\) and fit as many goods as possible from the warehouse and send them to the required shops.

Similarly, Warehouse = computer hard disk with various applications Lorry = RAM and RAM is the lorry which loads the required applications into it and make the applications run smoother.
