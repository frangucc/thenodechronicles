What's all this mean tho Gou, not everyones a genius like you. And what's a Rosetta stone gosh darnit?

**Bruh. You're not listening.** What I'm telling you is like, giving you a **Rosetta Stone,** for figuring out high tech hacking.

Yeah, but I'm not a math genius. I can't just learn this stuff like you, I'm not as smart as you.

But I really want to know this stuff like you!

**How you going to** learn **applied mathematics or coding** if you can't COMPREHEND what I'm telling you? And I'm not that booksmart either, I'm just a _hustler._ Ummm.. my **my teacher say's I'm really great at "comprehension! Does that help?"**

\[Gou ironically hands a bottle of water while is **playing "cap" **with the bottle - they're in the basement headquarters....\]

Don't facebook employees make a ton of money?

Bruh. They have the life.

I'm in dude. I'm going to commit to this and see if I can hack it.

Bruh, you don't want to just hack it, you need to own it. :p

Tell me more about this stone.

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DX-TKOyVwAIhxb4.jpg)

The stone was a hack written on a stone. It was **writen in Egyptian, Greek and Hyroglphs** at once so that anyone in the future could read what the **pharoah** had to say, but it also helped archeologists understand those ancient languages. The stone acts as a legend of sorts.

**So how's that relate? **

There's a **very specific set** of things **you need to know about EECS**, there's **even symbols** that represent the important **fundamentals you need to know**.

In addition to these **key schematic symbols**, I'm giving you all the rest of the must know things. Here, I put them on some cards for you called **Axiom Cards**.

Owning these cards is the key to becoming a hacker. Once you collect them all and understand them you can make some serious money.

Yeah, I even made an app so you can keep tabs on this stuff. It keeps track of what you know and gives you props and stuff when you POWN shit.

Money????

Yeah dude, Citrus Byte pays me $75 an hour to hack on iOS and Android apps.

Is that where you get all that money?

Yeah, from that and, my EGHHHEM, COUGH, bitminers.

**I'm gonna give you a similar stone right now, that will act as a legend for deciphering this stuff, it even has some "glyphs" of it's own.** It will help you always follow and **understand this stuff**, or **guide you**. If you follow the stone, you will **become an EECS major. **

It's the hackers guide to EECS man.

EECS?

**Archimedes** would **be turning in his grave right now...**

Electrical Engineering and Computer Science

**Whaaa?**

**Yeah, it's the dopest industry to be in. **
