John Bardeen + Shockley

That invention right there changed everything my dude.

It looks Egyptian. LOL.

Naji dude these guys were gangster.

If you combine what Turing & Cloude Shannon did with what these Electronics dudes did the Neckbeards built ontop of this crap, all the premise for all our computers, phones and modern software programs

Gou's not your average 13 year old boy. He's rolling infact, but you would never know by the way he acts. He's an elit3, a self-tought hacker that can write code, make PCB boards and likes hacking science.

His main interest is in Coils. He thinks we don't do a very good job with them as humans.

**GOU:** If everything we do in life is dictated by words in our vocabulary \(the thoughts in our minds and what fascinates us\), then it might also be said that language and culture can shape our future. Then I must ask; is there any way we could come to know a more universal language of technology, something that integrates the culture, emotion, global state and technology, with problem spaces that are deeply important to our civilization.

Among the teachings of science and technology, we include love, family and well being. It seems we can't get away from tech, and when learning it, we must not forget what it means to be human.

But despite all the readily available inspiration and information, what motivates students to flock to Universities around the world that offer clean rooms, academic research programs and places where the toughest problems on the planet are being solved, like Argon and Fermi, is still somewhat of a mystery. My point? How we are each led to these places seems all too random.

In case you're not following, in the end, what's happening is pretty simple. Technology is fairly new to humans. Apparently, modern humans have been running around this planet for 200,000 years without any of it. None of this. No phones, no google, no internet, no cars or tv's, no chips or radio waves, not even electric lights. But now, in just a fraction of that time, all those things exist.

According to mainstream archaeology, we've existed as a human race for approximately thousands of years without any modern technology. And in just 200 years, we built all this... And there are a lot more people now, exponentially more Einsteins.

A tremendous change occurred with the industrial revolution: whereas it had taken all of human history until around 1800 for world population to reach one billion, the second billion was achieved in only 130 years \(1930\), the third billion in less than 30 years \(1959\), the fourth billion in 15 years \(1974\), and the fifth billion in only 13 years \(1987\).

During the 20th century alone, the population in the world has grown from 1.65 billion to 6 billion. In 1970, there were roughly half as many people in the world as there are now.  
Because of declining growth rates, it will now take over 200 years to double again.

That must be a lot on millennial and generation Z. At some point, you have to wonder, is it our very next generation that we will struggle to communicate with next?

![](http://blogs.sap.com/innovation/files/2015/10/Wired-In.jpg)

You also have to think; with so many people, all over the world, doing so many things, do we ever get lost? Do scientists communicate efficiently with other generations? Or is all our efforts real value hidden in more and more papers that no one is reading. Is crap lost in big fat books and massive online documents, or on Khan Academy?

Dr. Louise Banks in the movie Arrival said, "Before we start throwing math problems at them, how about we try and talk to them first." A linguistics professor, she said this as she argued with her scientific counterpart sent out to greet the aliens. How one first might try and communicate with another intelligent life form is how I like to think I'm trying to communicate with teenagers reading this book.

After all, you \(teenagers\) are the ones who will carry on and shape all future tools and realize all future science. Naturally, other generations are concerned. What's guiding you? What paths will you take? Are your brains decensitized by all of this? Is it too overwhelming?

If an older generation were to develop a global language for communicating with the next generation, they would have to agree on certain things first. What are the first things we might all agree on? Will they be concerns for our planet? Will both generations agree on what could be holding humanity back? Is it all a zero sum game if we can't agree?

The brain is a powerful thing. In the 10 years from 9-19, it could process as many as 200 million thoughts. It has tremendous work to do in filing those thought. Processing them, deciding where they go, disposing of some.

Let me make this easier on you.

**Follow the stone.**
