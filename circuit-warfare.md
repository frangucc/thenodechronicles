And thus Colorado Springs March 1854 Tesla is trying out the form of human personal energy the idea if we could somehow tap into an earth street and obtain raw energy Basset fascinating indeed

**Tesla** and the basics of electricity and circuitry with references to John Bardeen and Jack Kilby. Experiments with the Arduino and blinking lights, electricity, voltage, measuring voltage, the very basics come together here while Gou fires up some basic breadboards and circuits. Enter Banzi and demonstrations of the Uno or Nano with relation to Energy! Theoretically, this chapter gives us a neat little intro to energy, voltage, electricity, basic circuits and some simple Arduino test projects that include resistors, capacitors, voltage, flow, current - very basic and simple circuit patters, gates, logic, fields, electromagnatism and sensors like hall, etc. We also disect an Arduino and get into it's anatomy and GPIO. You'll walk away with a reference to electrical engineering symbols, ability to read basic schematics and a good understanding of fields, forces and flows. 

**Chapter 3 \(**[**Neck Beards**](https://frangucc.gitbooks.io/gamifyed/content/remoting.html)**\) - **This chapter starts off with Ken and Dennis, creators of Unix at Bell Labs, inventing Unix on the PDP-11. It ends with Gou and his crew completely owning a Linux environment with all modern tools, which could have never happened without Unix.. ie, Bash, NPM, Node, Git, Terminals, tools, etc. Getting right into these meta tools \(Macro Axioms\) unlocks the power to do many other things later on, including installing different binaries, getting packages to run, getting Node.js running and we end by booting up some cool tools that users can instantly appreciate. You'll walk away with a good understanding of Linux and it's power, and knowledge of it's commands, file system, hierarchy and the basics of bash scripting, package management and installing virtually any package by reading it's readme.md while practicing getting up and running. The section wraps up with again, the running of a higher level, object or functional program \(node.js\) that ties everything together from a programs point of view.

**Chapter 4 \(**[**Network Access**](https://frangucc.gitbooks.io/gamifyed/content/connections.html)**\) - **
After, Sir Tim Berners-Lee gives us the invention of the internet and protocols like TCP/IP/HTTP and we can segue into SSH and getting into our PI's and Arduinos remotely with SSH and VNC after playing around with some network tools that are just down right cool. We get our environments fully internet ready and run our first Terminal driven IOT test after being networked into our PI from a remote machine. Book ends on that note, giving kids the ability to do things most adults can't. This chapter gives us a deeper look into the internet, protocols, IP addresses and how data and packets move across wires, so that later, IOT options make that much more sense, including some basics on storage, ssh and remote controlling devices over different transport protocols ranging from WIFI to BLUETOOTH or GSM. By the end, we learn to execute remote tasks on our machines, connect our PI to our Arduino so that we can flash it with scripts and we get our blinking light experiment created by RUSHI \(the pi currency script\) setup whereby a little precursor to data is unveiled. Big data could become the 2nd volume as opposed to the 5th. All future sensor projects require data. You'll walk away with knowledge of ports, packets, protocols and servers, with the ability to demonstrate how you can hack into your machines, remotely execute programs and get your machine to talk and listen while your not there \(alias say='echo "$1" \| espeak -s 120 2&gt;/dev/null'\). Processes, networking tools, pinging, etc will all make sense and be in constant context. You'll finalize this chapter again by wrapping all this into a higher level program \(Python\) that will prime your eventual IOT experiences in future volumes and abroad.

**NOTE: **Each chapter has a blend of history, present day fiction built ontop the history and theory \( storytelling with the cast\), hardware and programming. The chapters \(and volumes\) all build on each-other until eventually, readers have a complete knowledge of EECS AI systems.

**All future books will be based in the order:**

**Volume 1 -** The Hacker Way \(in progress\)

**Volume 2 -** Big Data \(need name\)

**Volume 3 -** Biomechanics \(need name\)

**Volume 4 -** Biosensing \(need name\)

**Volume 5 - **Robotics \(need name\)
