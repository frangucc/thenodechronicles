And so here begins The Node Chronicles, where sometime in the not too distant future, “Gou Sokyeo” will become, no doubt, a unicorn beast.

Unfortunately, the World as we knew it had become a very difficult place to live. The Great Loss of Direction gave rise to dishonest governments and filthy rich mega corporations, ruled by the wealthiest of wealthy and their clans; humanity had reached a tipping point.

As the turbulent technology era struck, a certain schitzophrenia took over the people, and ultimately, humans grew less sufficient and mentally weak. It was still unclear if society would come together and prevail, or if the civilization as we know it, would fall. 



In a time when the next generation most needed an answer, Gou Sokyeo would soon bring the world together with an open source solution that could forever unlock each of owns destinies.

Unfortunately, becoming a unicorn had gotten really dangerous. Gou Sokyeo, his brother Nōn and sister Lilu now faced many new challenges.  



For the people, Gou encoded each aspect of the teaching as a symbol and created a new periodic table of electrical computing elements. So that we would never forget, he laser enscribed them into a crystal quartz stone. For each collection of symbols unlocked together, an opportunity would prevail, and a new device could be created to help contribute towards the future. 

"I’ve created a collection of symbols that represent everything you need to know about electro mechanical machines of all sizes, even biological."

The open-source pioneering work you'll complete with Gou will lead you into the world of coding, hardware hacking, peer-to-peer networking, circuitry, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Eventually, Gou and his teachings will help instill a profound cultural foundation of knowledge that you can use to pioneer in every field. 

A civilzation free from subscriptions, surveillance, money and consumerism, is on the verge and for the next generation, it's back to the drawing board. 

So tonight, as dawn approaches, stay awake with Gou from his old Garfield Park Manor HQ, together with Node and The Sokyeo Clan and hack your way into your own personal future:

Aware, like a fox crossing the water. 
Alert, like a general on the battlefield.
Kind, like a hostess greeting her guests.
Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood.
Opaque, like black pools in darkened caves.
