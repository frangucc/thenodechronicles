THIS AREA NEEDS CLEANUP

War of Art

 Man you talking books?  [knocking the dust off dads old books]  

Reading this book is the ultimate hook-up.

The arch of the covenant is about to be found, don’t you watch SCI?

Prometheous? They win.

No, the FBI wins when the Lagina brothers disappear. 

The historians are gonna be huge, way bigger than the MIT monks.

Why did the MIT monks become monks in the first place Gou? What you know about them? 

I know exactly why. They all grew neckbeards and got fat, from sitting around too much and not taking care. They dialed-in, literally. It got pretty gross. Some even began eating super-foods called manna. They wore helmets and glasses with AR, MR, Neurtransmitters, Projecters, Vibrators, All sorts of stupid stuff. 

Pretty cool though. 

A lot of people got tired of stuff though. People at the Dolores Park started throwing rocks at the tech what-nots. Bad asses started ditching their phones and computers, but none of that mattered. The people who had money were off doing their thing, and only the journalists could pose a threat. 

Those larpers watching over us, paying attention, became the black panthers, the anonymous, who pointed things out - yeah, but to whom, and why? The world is kinky, you better get ready for it. Just knowing all this could get you shot. 

Paranoid much? Idiot. 

They say old people can’t even read this stuff, and that it’s too deep for kids. 

What like somethings hidden in the language? [arrival image of the ink circles]

The worlds most coveted artifact is not buried on Oak Island, it’s in your head. 

All over the world, whenever civilizations got scientific and artistic, they also got violent, and all the violence, got evil. 

Oh so now you’re talking religion? Man, you are all over the place. 

Bro, I’m not interested in your religion, but I respect your right to believe in whatever you want, as long as it doesn’t effect me. 

But how you…
 Dude, I said NOT NOW. 

Ok, well then how about this….

Why do you think Elon’s sending 4,000 satellites into space? What else is on those things?

Nodes man, how do we make them indestructible? 

William Gattery! 

Will you shut up? I’m serious, I wanna put a node on our roof, then one at Garfield Park. I want DATA!!!!!!

I want knowledge.   Knowledge of what?   I want enough knowledge to know what I’m doing. 

Hmm… Makes sense. I like that. Let’s go with that. 

So back to Elon.  

He’s looking for satellite imagery, to build a new internet.

…to charge people and control things… 

Yeah, probably, but eventually he’ll get compromised, I’m sure. 

The CIA, UN and China probably have the most advanced 

The Zete’s special ops - Mexican geniuses, they use cartels. 
 No, this isn’t cartel, this is government. Russian?

Probably. 

Man, who knows. Aliens could be building this shit.   Aliens might just be F’ing with us?

You talking about hacking or computer science dude, or coding?

Becoming an inventor. You need to be able to GO. 

That why they call you GOU? 

Go lang, go hard. 

You’re a try-hard. You say stuff that doesn’t even make sense. 

Look at the data I’m getting off CLIP. 

What’s CLIP?   It’s a Node I put on the roof. 

I think even the mayans knew how important data, knowledge and information was. Seemed like they could transmit their historical data across generations much better than we could.   We don’t even know what happened 50 years ago on this planet, or if Hitler escaped, or if we paid for it. 

This planet is jacked. 

So you’re saying the modern Jesus will be someone who see’s all that?  Or you saying Yeezus finna discover the kid who saw all this. 

Yes, I’m saying the later. 

These things power themselves up, get power from the sun, don’t need nobody to be there and pass you back data?  What kinda data we talking and let’s see it. I call bullshit. 

Bet.   And where’s LIlu? I need help with some code-math. I need her to help me with some input vectors on this classifier. Only she knows how to use the Bayes’ Theorem. I always mess it up. 

The MAYAN’s were obsessed with ART and SCIENCE, only their computers were made with quartz and engrained in the earth. 

Tesla knew something was up, but he didn’t have the backers. 

Dad was a CTO and Creative Director, and those creeps Brad and Eric tried to keep him down. He came face to face with the smartest jews on earth, but dad was a….

Was a what? No, wait… don’t talk about dad like that. I don’t wanna hear it.  I DON’T WANNA #@*$(@%!*& HEAR IT. 

Arg… the worlds flocking in so many directions, I can’t keep up. 
 Broham, checkout the Human Taxonomy Project, it’s WILD. 

There’s probably 50,000 Einstein’s alive today. Just like there’s probably  5,000 Messi’s 

heh, Science is a lot older. 

Ultimately, there’s a lot of BS out there, but science is mixing with archeology, just like it is with Medicine. 

And bro, one group of people are talking one way, and telling only have the truth, and the other people are talking that way, and telling the other part of the truth.

Where you choose to work, is a big deal.

But isn’t where you choose to work what defines your mission? 
 Nah, not really. Wherever I end up working it will just be a step in the process.

A step? Dude, what are you talking about?

I’m sayin, people are nuts. There’s only one thing I know. When I stay focused on learning something, I don’t stop. And if I think it’s important, I’m gonna learn it.   I want to know energy, first and foremost. Without it, it’s hard to do anything about it. 

Then I want to know algos and physics. I also want to know how the human body works; specifically, neural networks. I think if I know that, I can figure out what all those other cell thingy thingy and gobuoles are all about. 

What like viruses? Yeah, well, my dad always says, Erlang sorta works the way the human body works, and functional message passing is the way nerves communicate. He said certain things can emit signals and other certain things can receive them, and that when you become a *$&#*@&$^ G ass programmer you realize this shit and keep it to yourself. It’s too powerful, too dangerous. Really becoming a coder can make you a god. 
 Dude, there’s so many gods. And history is so bass ackwards, the stuff going on 50 and 150 and 500 years ago is so insane. And you think you’re bored? People got together in colosseums and watched people die. Whole villages were kidnapped and made slaves, tortured and murdered. Millions of jews were incinerated by a dude who we never caught. 

So what’s history got to do bruh?   It’s all related man, and history is shaped like an ABHA torus. 
 Oh man, 


Menwith Hill - the power to read all communications. You could be in trouble man. 

Dude, this is about having access to everything.

There’s so many groups. Checking out this Human Taxonomy Project now. 

The dudes flying around drones, listening to microwave antennas - Snowden keeps talking about them. 

Nothing is off limits for these guys. 

You could easily get lost in paranoia - we try and stay above it. 

You know Einstein said, in order to solve a problem, you need to think a level much higher above.

Brohamad, that doesn’t stop the fact that Turing cracked the German Enigma, and that helped end the war. And that wars in the future will be fought with data, economies and space. 
 We are actually living in the time, that people once warned us about.

What’s guarded at Menwith Hill is ….

A warning written in trees, scarring on the bottom of the ocean, collecting algae

What on earth show bro. Who’s keeping tabs on all this? Shit going on? 

Let me break it down for you. 

It’s biology, physics, math, coding and energy.  But we don’t have any of it right, not yet. 

Oh, and ART, AI and ROBOTS, so you can sit back.
 And one more thing. All you need to know about history is that we’re catching on quick, closing in and something big is about to happen. 

We may find the arc, and if we do, it might be information, on how we can pull everything together. 

Humans are like insects, and believe it or not, we have the tools to communicate at levels so high, we don’t even get it, but it’s what enables us to build such large structures. 

I’m not sure they’re so big man. 

Seems like there bigger things poppin before. 

Don’t you think it’s strange how weird stuff was just hundreds of years ago, let alone thousands?  Dude, there’s so much weird stuff happing on the planet, I’ll stick with the Growth Hackers. 

Why? Because they seem to find the money to be able to actually go up and fight. 

You’ll probably be a late observer (sucks 4 u). Ujjwal says to “ASK MORE QUESTIONS” - it’s the best brainstorming tool we have. 

Do do you really think the Knights Templar curried the arc of the covenant on Oak Island? And if we’re not allowed to ask questions about Menwith Hill, what makes you think you’ll get your hands on any of the sauce bruh? 

Look man, superfoods machines, Rodin coils, I need someone I can trust, who can show me the way. I don’t know what’s right, wrong, true, false. It’s too much.. 

But I do wanna help. 

Yup, that’s why I made you the stone. 

Read between the lines. Read it over and over, it’ll make sense.

So what you say man. 
 Be on the lookout for strange symbols, that spell out words of warning. 

Look for cash from the vc’s and cryptos to fund your recon, but don’t let anyone get in your pocket. You’ve bog 10-20 years to figure it out. 

Dad blew out. Don’t be like him.

AND DON’T SWEAT IT. 

So, back to the stone. Go’head. 

Let’s take the bad hacker, for example. He unlocks so much information and figures out so many tools and exploits, he creates systems that run long-term that get away with millions.

But doing what? Anything. 

Like Growth Hackers. 

Why do I get the feeling that each time we figure out technology and space, we simultaneously kill ourselves, and have to start over. 

Limestone bruh, let’s figure out what to do with that. 

Why limestone? Why not quartz. 

Ok quartz. Can we pass a signal through it? 

Yeah, and it’s cheap, there’s lots of it. 

You will need land, or you’ll need to build an obelisk. Had to bring it up?

What’s next, gonna start talking about pyramids? Vortex Energy, Marko Rodin?   Dude, no, and I’m not a conspiracy theorist. I’m just thinking outside the box, way ahead about what I wanna get into, so I can spend LOT’S of time planning. 

But you got all these other haters, why you foolin wit me? 

Sauce me that remote, you spend too much time on Fortnite. You a dead head. 

Back to your stones. 

My stone dude. My stone. 

Why were there so many people before building crazy stuff all over the planet. 
 How come people 100 years ago got around more than you?

He he he he.

Or why was there work so much more important? 

So much wasted opportunity [image of the fat]

Seems like the people who got the money to buy land and build stuff have the right idea.   To get there, you might have to go out and make something, on your own. 
 But before that, you may have had to work somewhere and prove yourself, by contributing something, and so you could live a normal life.

Living a normal life is very important, because the neckbeards also had issues. 
 They became more likely to abuse drugs even, or worse, not do any at all. 

Go figure.

Also I know is there’s paranoia at different levels. 

Depending on which level you get caught up in, the more serious you think about life this way.   To explorers, it’s like a profession, that we know more about what’s out there. 
 To hackers, it’s either about money or knowing the truth. 

To theorists, it’s always about the possibility. 

So what’s the moral of the story?  They’re not gonna read any of it anyways. They’re just gonna look at the pictures, and think it’s crazy.   But people see crazy every day. 
 Our president is crazy.

Who knows, but you can’t argue that whoever doing whatever they want wherever they want, aren’t more important than the president anyhow. 

Tru dat. 

There’s people becoming famous and rich off just talking about all this stuff. 

Ha, losers.
