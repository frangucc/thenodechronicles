Yeah, but you've been doing this stuff for a hot minute Gou. And isn't hacking bad? \[redundant\]

**Gou: **Hackers are just people that don't want to accept bullshart as the norm, so they mess around and try to beat tech. They **are always trying to figure out the next move by learning from what's out there**. As a result, they help figure out what to **build next**. Or how to fix things so they can better benefit the **overall industry. **

\[illustrate hackers at industry, awesome jobs, working on cool shit, hackathons, Illustrate the GAME! search these things, hackerspaces, hackathons, hacking, clean rooms, computer science labs, mit labs\]

**Non: Hackers.** \(huh...\)

**Ok, so go on.** **Tell me more.** I want to be a hacker.![](/assets/node-non-3.jpg)![](/assets/node-non-4.jpg)

Non: That what your boy Tesla was about?

**If you understand electrcity,** **fields, forces and flows**, it becomes easier to **visualize** how the lowest level of the **science and tech works** - when it's **beyond the naked eye** and you're dealing with **binary and math.**

**So** I need to be a geek?

**No, **but you **\*\*need to respect it and **make room for it.** A lot of math is done for you and not everyone has to understand **machine code** and **nyquist rates\*\* to build stuff.

**Gou:** Dude, I'm done talking to you right now. I've got work to do. GET OUT OF MY ROOM!!!!

Non: So all these **chips and machines** that make up our **hardware, these microprocessors, memory, motors, etc.** all basically take **voltage from power** sources and **translate them into information **or **motors** somehow?

**Yeah, sorta. **

Let's fire up a Raspberry Pi Zero, the worlds smallest computer, and learn about it's parts. **

**Check it.** Basically, you need to know about** electricity and chips,** how they work, and then you need to know how to** put an OS on them **so you can **control them or write pograms to control them**. When you **write the programs**, that's when you'll study **object oriented or functional software. **

**That's when **you write the codes...

![](/assets/node-10.jpg)

**Yup.**

**And** once you know about that stuff, you can learn to **put all your stuff online **and **control stuff** from anywhere you are.

**Like the matrix?**

You need to fire up a Linux machine and get to a Python shell so we can write some code.

**Bruh. **Will you stop with the analogies, let me make the analogies.

Ok.

**So let me recap.**

**Electricity & Chips =&gt; Operating Systems like Linux =&gt; Coding and Scripts =&gt; Networking and the Internet?**

**Yes. **Study the stuff in **that order**. And **don't go off the path** - learn what I give you and nothing else right now. There's no time for wastin - it's getting late, you're **already in high school and you're still a newb**. If you don't **grasp** this stuff now, you'll have a** 2% chance** of winning at all in this field.

**Bruh, **please. I'm non-che-b, Gou-nin-yho.

Please don't call me that.

Gou: **Do** you even know what software **engineers** make? Or hardware **hackers**?

Non: **No, **but I know I'd rather be a **Zuck or an Elon Musk** any day of the week before a **Kanye or Kardash.**

Gou: **Kan-yeezy** bruh. Don't dis Kankye. He's so **baller**.

**Dab. **

\[Scene ends with both brothers dabbing perfectly, hard as hell.\]
