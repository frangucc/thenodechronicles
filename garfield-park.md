Yeah, but you've been doing this stuff for a hot minute Gou. And isn't hacking bad? \[redundant\]



Hackers are just people that don't want to accept bullshart as the norm, so they mess around and try to beat tech. They **are always trying to figure out the next move by learning from what's out there**. As a result, they help figure out what to **build next**. Or how to fix things so they can better benefit the **overall industry. **

\[illustrate hackers at industry, awesome jobs, working on cool shit, hackathons, Illustrate the GAME! search these things, hackerspaces, hackathons, hacking, clean rooms, computer science labs, mit labs\]

**Hackers.** \(huh...\)

Yeah, dude, **Alan Turing,** the dude who invented the **modern concept of a computer,** was literally **CRACKING the German Enigma** when he came up with the** Turing Machine.** His hack saved millions of lives in WWII. The turing machine is the premis for how all modern processors and memory inside your computers work, and how computer think. It's how all that stuff you **play with on your phone get's processed by the chips and stuff!**

**Ok, so go on.** **Tell me more.** I want to be a hacker.

**Bruh,** first you need to understand that to **comprehend this stuff**, you need to **take notes** on what I'm telling you and you need to **fit the pieces together **yourself. I'm only going to **give you clues** on what must know things you need to study.** I'll point you in the rigt direction**, always, but if you have what it takes to a hacker, you'll **figure this crap out yourself**. There's no need to pay attention to other stuff. I've got your **Rosetta Stone **for learning this shit.

**Hahah. Gou's Stone. **

**Here's **how it all basically works.

\[We need a literally "text" vesion of Gou's stone we can give away\]

\[And we need a dope glowing stone that can represent the legend for all 5 volumes and mastery of EECS. It should look like a combiation of the rosetta stone and some cool glowing stone.\]

\[DIAGRAM/IMAGE/ART - intro to MAP, finger points on a page to map or whiteboard. Map or Stone Map, or the stone is a place on this map... So far on the map we have - {Gous stone, the basement hq, the EE pyramids in an area, the OS land, the Coding building and Network - it's a very high level diagram for now, but you can tell it will be zoomed into later for deeper subjects. sneak in some other mystery - Dads dirty closet, Lilu's tree-house, the rabbi's temple, dr. winslows lab, ladybugs hideout, teslas corporation, zuck...}

**If you understand electrcity,** **fields, forces and flows**, it becomes easier to **visualize** how the lowest level of the **science and tech works** - when it's **beyond the naked eye** and you're dealing with **binary and math.**

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1475878073/molecule_csquem.jpg)

**So** I need to be a math geek?

**No, **but you **\*\*need to respect it and **make room for it.** A lot of math is done for you and not everyone has to understand **machine code** and **nyquist rates\*\* to build stuff.

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1475878071/boom_rye5oi.jpg)

**But** if you wanna get into MIT, and you don't understand the basics of **Electromagnetism**, **current**, **frequency**, **key algorithms, etc.** you're not gonna get very far.

**Like** the Big-O notation?

**Will you stop!** That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. But, well, yes, like the Big-O, but not in that example. Ughh,,.. Nevermind.

Non: So all these **chips and machines** that make up our **hardware, these microprocessors, memory, motors, etc.** all basically take **voltage from power** sources and **translate them into information **or **motors** somehow?

**Yeah, sorta. **

**Check it.** Basically, you need to know about** electricity and chips,** how they work, and then you need to know how to** put an OS on them **so you can **control them or write pograms to control them**. When you **write the programs**, that's when you'll study **object oriented or functional software. **

**That's when **you write the codes...

**Yup.**

**And** once you know about that stuff, you can learn to **put all your stuff online **and **control stuff** from anywhere you are.

**Like the matrix?**

**Bruh. **Will you stop with the analogies, let me make the analogies.

Ok.

**So let me recap.**

**Electricity & Chips =&gt; Operating Systems like Linux =&gt; Coding and Scripts =&gt; Networking and the Internet?**

**Yes. **Study the stuff in **that order**. And **don't go off the path** - learn what I give you and nothing else right now. There's no time for wastin - it's getting late, you're **already in high school and you're still a newb**. If you don't **grasp** this stuff now, you'll have a** 2% chance** of winning at all in this field.

**Bruh, **please. I'm non-che-b, Gou-nin-yho.

Please don't call me that.

Gou: **Do** you even know what software **engineers** make? Or hardware **hackers**?

Non: **No, **but I know I'd rather be a **Zuck or an Elon Musk** any day of the week before a **Kanye or Kardash.**

Gou: **Kan-yeezy** bruh. Don't dis Kankye. He's so **baller**.

**Dab. **

\[Scene ends with both brothers dabbing perfectly, hard as hell.\]

Ok, let's start from the beginning. What did Tesla do and what do I need to know about him?

I like where your heads at.

So check it out....

**GOU:** If everything we do in life is dictated by words in our vocabulary \(the thoughts in our minds and what fascinates us\), then it might also be said that language and culture can shape our future. Then I must ask; is there any way we could come to know a more universal language of technology, something that integrates the culture, emotion, global state and technology, with problem spaces that are deeply important to our civilization.

Among the teachings of science and technology, we include love, family and well being. It seems we can't get away from tech, and when learning it, we must not forget what it means to be human.

But despite all the readily available inspiration and information, what motivates students to flock to Universities around the world that offer clean rooms, academic research programs and places where the toughest problems on the planet are being solved, like Argon and Fermi, is still somewhat of a mystery. My point? How we are each led to these places seems all too random.

In case you're not following, in the end, what's happening is pretty simple. Technology is fairly new to humans. Apparently, modern humans have been running around this planet for 200,000 years without any of it. None of this. No phones, no google, no internet, no cars or tv's, no chips or radio waves, not even electric lights. But now, in just a fraction of that time, all those things exist.

According to mainstream archaeology, we've existed as a human race for approximately thousands of years without any modern technology. And in just 200 years, we built all this... And there are a lot more people now, exponentially more Einsteins.

A tremendous change occurred with the industrial revolution: whereas it had taken all of human history until around 1800 for world population to reach one billion, the second billion was achieved in only 130 years \(1930\), the third billion in less than 30 years \(1959\), the fourth billion in 15 years \(1974\), and the fifth billion in only 13 years \(1987\).

During the 20th century alone, the population in the world has grown from 1.65 billion to 6 billion. In 1970, there were roughly half as many people in the world as there are now.
Because of declining growth rates, it will now take over 200 years to double again.

That must be a lot on millennial and generation Z. At some point, you have to wonder, is it our very next generation that we will struggle to communicate with next?

![](http://blogs.sap.com/innovation/files/2015/10/Wired-In.jpg)

You also have to think; with so many people, all over the world, doing so many things, do we ever get lost? Do scientists communicate efficiently with other generations? Or is all our efforts real value hidden in more and more papers that no one is reading. Is crap lost in big fat books and massive online documents, or on Khan Academy?

Dr. Louise Banks in the movie Arrival said, "Before we start throwing math problems at them, how about we try and talk to them first." A linguistics professor, she said this as she argued with her scientific counterpart sent out to greet the aliens. How one first might try and communicate with another intelligent life form is how I like to think I'm trying to communicate with teenagers reading this book.

After all, you \(teenagers\) are the ones who will carry on and shape all future tools and realize all future science. Naturally, other generations are concerned. What's guiding you? What paths will you take? Are your brains decensitized by all of this? Is it too overwhelming?

If an older generation were to develop a global language for communicating with the next generation, they would have to agree on certain things first. What are the first things we might all agree on? Will they be concerns for our planet? Will both generations agree on what could be holding humanity back? Is it all a zero sum game if we can't agree?

The brain is a powerful thing. In the 10 years from 9-19, it could process as many as 200 million thoughts. It has tremendous work to do in filing those thought. Processing them, deciding where they go, disposing of some.
