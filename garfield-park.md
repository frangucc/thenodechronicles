Yeah, but you've been doing this stuff for a hot minute Gou. And isn't hacking bad? \[redundant\]

**Gou: **Hackers are just people that don't want to accept bullshart as the norm, so they mess around and try to beat tech. They **are always trying to figure out the next move by learning from what's out there**. As a result, they help figure out what to **build next**. Or how to fix things so they can better benefit the **overall industry. **

\[illustrate hackers at industry, awesome jobs, working on cool shit, hackathons, Illustrate the GAME! search these things, hackerspaces, hackathons, hacking, clean rooms, computer science labs, mit labs\]

**Non: Hackers.** \(huh...\)

Yeah, dude, **Alan Turing,** the dude who invented the **modern concept of a computer,** was literally **CRACKING the German Enigma** when he came up with the** Turing Machine.** His hack saved millions of lives in WWII. The turing machine is the premis for how all modern processors and memory inside your computers work, and how computer think. It's how all that stuff you **play with on your phone get's processed by the chips and stuff!**

**Ok, so go on.** **Tell me more.** I want to be a hacker.

Non: That what your boy Tesla was about?

**If you understand electrcity,** **fields, forces and flows**, it becomes easier to **visualize** how the lowest level of the **science and tech works** - when it's **beyond the naked eye** and you're dealing with **binary and math.**

**So** I need to be a geek?

**No, **but you **\*\*need to respect it and **make room for it.** A lot of math is done for you and not everyone has to understand **machine code** and **nyquist rates\*\* to build stuff.

**Non:** That what got JP all P'd off?

**Gou:** Goof. Yeah, he was a D-I-S-R-U-P-T-O-R!!!

But if you wanna get into MIT, and you don't understand the basics of **Electromagnetism**, **current**, **frequency**, **key algorithms, etc.** you're not gonna get very far.

**Non:** Like the Big-O notation?

**Will you stop!** That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. But, well, yes, like the Big-O, but not in that example. Ughh,,.. Nevermind.

**Gou:** Dude, I'm done talking to you right now. I've got work to do. GET OUT OF MY ROOM!!!!

Non: So all these **chips and machines** that make up our **hardware, these microprocessors, memory, motors, etc.** all basically take **voltage from power** sources and **translate them into information **or **motors** somehow?

**Yeah, sorta. **

Let's fire up a Raspberry Pi Zero, the worlds smallest computer, and learn about it's parts. **  
**![](/assets/node-pi-zero.jpg)

**Check it.** Basically, you need to know about** electricity and chips,** how they work, and then you need to know how to** put an OS on them **so you can **control them or write pograms to control them**. When you **write the programs**, that's when you'll study **object oriented or functional software. **

**That's when **you write the codes...

**Yup.**

**And** once you know about that stuff, you can learn to **put all your stuff online **and **control stuff** from anywhere you are.

**Like the matrix?**

**Bruh. **Will you stop with the analogies, let me make the analogies.

Ok.

**So let me recap.**

**Electricity & Chips =&gt; Operating Systems like Linux =&gt; Coding and Scripts =&gt; Networking and the Internet?**

**Yes. **Study the stuff in **that order**. And **don't go off the path** - learn what I give you and nothing else right now. There's no time for wastin - it's getting late, you're **already in high school and you're still a newb**. If you don't **grasp** this stuff now, you'll have a** 2% chance** of winning at all in this field.

**Bruh, **please. I'm non-che-b, Gou-nin-yho.

Please don't call me that.

Gou: **Do** you even know what software **engineers** make? Or hardware **hackers**?

Non: **No, **but I know I'd rather be a **Zuck or an Elon Musk** any day of the week before a **Kanye or Kardash.**

Gou: **Kan-yeezy** bruh. Don't dis Kankye. He's so **baller**.

**Dab. **

\[Scene ends with both brothers dabbing perfectly, hard as hell.\]
