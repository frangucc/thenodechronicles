**Gou: **Dad bought this place from an old judge before they decentralized everything. No one owned anything except for what they were willing to fight for. When the federal reserve and banks collapsed \(they call it the paper\), things got nuts for a while.

**Gou:** Dad used to actually carry around this stuff called cash. He paid for stuff wit these things called dollars. Including this house.

**Non: **

**Non: **What's up with dad? Why does he hate technology so much?

**Gou: **Vero said that just before he fell apart, he had a vision one night of the future, and predicted the collapse and that humanity would divide into two major groups, each with hundreds of segments. He said the prosperous, aka the unicorns would selfishly leave the planet and leave the rest of us 10 billion people here to struggle.

He said that the moment the world realized just how truly sick Mother Nature was, all of humanities priorities would change. He predicted all of this.

In his vision he witnessed the collapse of schools, police stations and even hospitals. With such limited time left, he predicted the crunch time.

**Non:** Then why was he so against us hacking, and getting into technology?

**Gou: **The technologies the prosperous left us were scary. The CRISPR platform got so easy, that people could literally program new genetic traits.

**Non: **Like in all those new Marvel movies? Mutants?

**Gou: **Yeah. Even crazier.

Dad went crazy playing all this out, trying to figure out what to do, how to preserve his family. He got overwhelmed.

Is that why he shut down?

He didn't shut down. He's not telling us everything. He's worried about us.

As the Crunch Time Era reached it's peak, the human brain proved just how capable it was and Artificial Intelligence blew past our expectations.  AI itself unveiled millions of new materials, chemicals, hacks, genetic configurations and so on. Humans and AI worked together as all of science fiction became real.

So why the rise of hackers?

**Gou: **They labelled us hackers because we literally had to hack through the science that was left for us to save ourselves. After the collapse, the corporations shut down too. All those obsessed with marketing and making money. With such limited time left, people only cared about a few things.

Non: Like what?

Gou: Growing their own food, harnessing their own energy, building their own ships and protecting their klans.

Non: It's almost as if history has been staring us in the face, this whole time. Like our whole time on this planet is mirrored by the what happens in the future.

Gou: It feels like this all happened before and that we've been staring right at it, this whole time. It seems that no matter how big the population got throughout history, we always ended up in the same situation. The more intelligent man became, the quicker it destroyed everything and had to escape.

Non: Yeah, but this event is gonna be wild. There's over 10 billion people on the planet. There's only so much room.

That's why hacking is now considered the number one survival tool. We need to do everything ourselves.

Thank god for the new materials. Bet they didn't have all these the last time.

**Non: Hackers.** \(huh...\)

**Ok, so go on.** **Tell me more.** I want to be a hacker.![](/assets/node-non-3.jpg)![](/assets/node-non-4.jpg)

Non: That what your boy Tesla was about?

**If you understand electrcity,** **fields, forces and flows**, it becomes easier to **visualize** how the lowest level of the **science and tech works** - when it's **beyond the naked eye** and you're dealing with **binary and math.**

**So** I need to be a geek?

**No, **but you **\*\*need to respect it and **make room for it.** A lot of math is done for you and not everyone has to understand **machine code** and **nyquist rates\*\* to build stuff.

**Gou:** Dude, I'm done talking to you right now. I've got work to do. GET OUT OF MY ROOM!!!!

Non: So all these **chips and machines** that make up our **hardware, these microprocessors, memory, motors, etc.** all basically take **voltage from power** sources and **translate them into information **or **motors** somehow?

**Yeah, sorta. **

Let's fire up a Raspberry Pi Zero, the worlds smallest computer, and learn about it's parts. **                                
**![](/assets/node-pi-zero.jpg)

**Check it.** Basically, you need to know about** electricity and chips,** how they work, and then you need to know how to** put an OS on them **so you can **control them or write pograms to control them**. When you **write the programs**, that's when you'll study **object oriented or functional software. **



**That's when **you write the codes...

![](/assets/node-10.jpg)

**Yup.**

**And** once you know about that stuff, you can learn to **put all your stuff online **and **control stuff** from anywhere you are.

**Like the matrix?**

You need to fire up a Linux machine and get to a Python shell so we can write some code.

**Bruh. **Will you stop with the analogies, let me make the analogies.

Ok.

**So let me recap.**

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYHfJ8KV4AAaoGR.jpg)

**Electricity & Chips =&gt; Operating Systems like Linux =&gt; Coding and Scripts =&gt; Networking and the Internet?**

**Yes. **Study the stuff in **that order**. And **don't go off the path** - learn what I give you and nothing else right now. There's no time for wastin - it's getting late, you're **already in high school and you're still a newb**. If you don't **grasp** this stuff now, you'll have a** 2% chance** of winning at all in this field.

**Bruh, **please. I'm non-che-b, Gou-nin-yho.

Please don't call me that.

Gou: **Do** you even know what software **engineers** make? Or hardware **hackers**?

Non: **No, **but I know I'd rather be a **Zuck or an Elon Musk** any day of the week before a **Kanye or Kardash.**

Gou: **Kan-yeezy** bruh. Don't dis Kankye. He's so **baller**.

**Dab. **

\[Scene ends with both brothers dabbing perfectly, hard as hell.\]
